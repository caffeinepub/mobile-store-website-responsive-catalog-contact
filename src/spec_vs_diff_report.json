      "requirement": "Update the backend authorization so the Principal `ksdex-jr3fp-ll2uw-hoqgv-wlwa7-erlfc-juio3-m33lu-7dqc7-hzatt-uqe` is registered/granted admin permissions during canister initialization, so that admin checks and admin-gated methods allow this Principal.",
      "reason": "No changes were made to `backend/main.mo` (or any backend code) to seed/register the specified Principal as an admin or to adjust `isCallerAdmin()`/admin-gated checks. The only modified file is `project_state.json`, which marks the work as pending.",

      "reason": "No backend upgrade/migration logic was added or modified (e.g., `backend/migration.mo`), and there are no code changes indicating state persistence across upgrades. The only modified file is `project_state.json`, which marks this as pending.",
