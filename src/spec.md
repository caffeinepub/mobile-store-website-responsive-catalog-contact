# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update site-wide Contact Us information and add a subtle iPhone watermark visible across all pages.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace all displayed Contact Us details site-wide with the exact new address, phone number, and email (including Contact page info cards, Contact page map placeholder text, and footer Contact Us section).
- Add a subtle, non-interfering iPhone watermark overlay/background that appears on all pages and uses a static image asset from `frontend/public/assets/generated`.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors see the updated Contact Us address/phone/email everywhere it appears, and all pages display a subtle iPhone watermark without affecting readability or usability.
